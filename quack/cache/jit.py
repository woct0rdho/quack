"""Persistent ``.o`` cache for CuTe DSL compiled kernels.

Compiled kernels are exported as object files (``.o``) via ``export_to_c``. On
subsequent runs the ``.o`` is loaded via tvm_ffi (~1 ms) instead of
re-generating IR + re-JIT'ing (~500 ms per kernel).

Runtime config (``CACHE_ENABLED``, ``CACHE_DIR``, ``EXTRA_SOURCE_DIRS``)
lives in :mod:`quack.cache` (the package init).

When an async compile pool is active (see :mod:`quack.cache.async_compile`),
a cold miss is shipped to a CPU worker and :class:`CompilePending` is raised
instead of compiling in-process; the caller (pytest defer loop, autotune
bench loop) retries once the ``.o`` lands.

    The decorated function should return a compiled kernel (i.e. call cute.compile).
    The disk cache key is (fn.__qualname__, *args, **sorted_kwargs).

    Concurrency model
    -----------------
    The disk side uses a per-key ``{sha}.lock`` file (advisory ``filelock``):

    * **Fast path (warm cache).** If the ``.o`` file already exists, we take a
      shared lock just long enough to ``load_module`` it. Many readers can
      proceed concurrently.
    * **Slow path (cold cache).** The actual ``fn(*args, **kwargs)`` compile
      runs *under* the exclusive lock. This serializes redundant compilations
      of the same key across xdist workers / processes: if N processes race
      on a cold key, only one calls ``cute.compile``; the rest wait for the
      lock, see the ``.o`` appear, and load it. (Previously the compile ran
      *between* the shared-lock check and the exclusive-lock export, so all
      N processes wasted CPU compiling the same key in parallel — wall time
      was unchanged but compile-CPU pressure scaled with concurrency, which
      starved other compiles when many keys were cold at once.)

    The lock is per-key, so distinct keys never contend with each other.
