"""Reusable pytest plugin for QuACK async kernel compilation.

Adds the ``--async-compile[=N]`` CLI flag: on a kernel-compile ``.o``-cache
miss, the compile is shipped to a pool of N CPU workers (forkserver sidecar,
see :mod:`quack.cache.async_compile`), the test is deferred while other tests
run, and it is retried once the ``.o`` is exported. Zero overhead when the
cache is warm. Works single-process and under xdist (both ``load`` and
``worksteal`` schedulers).

To opt in, add this line to your ``conftest.py``::

    pytest_plugins = ["quack.testing.pytest_plugin"]

    """Cache ``_pytest.compat.getfuncargnames`` by stable function identity.

    Performance background
    ----------------------
    Pytest's fixture resolution calls ``getfuncargnames`` ~20 times per test
    (once per active fixture / parametrize axis). Each call runs
    ``inspect.signature(function)`` from scratch — a deep AST/Signature build
    with no caching upstream. For a 2k-test file this is ~40k
    ``inspect.signature`` invocations and ~1 s of pure CPU per worker. See
    pytest-dev/pytest#11284 (open since 2023) for the underlying root cause:
    pytest probes the entire fixture closure for every test instead of just
    the test's ``initialnames``.

    Caching by ``id(function)`` does NOT work: the ``request`` fixture is
    rebuilt per test, producing thousands of distinct function objects with
    identical signatures. Cache by ``(qualname, co_filename, co_firstlineno)``
    instead — that triple is stable across the per-test wrappers and uniquely
    identifies a Python function definition.

    Deliberate tradeoffs
    --------------------
    This is a monkey-patch of pytest's private API (``_pytest.compat`` and
    ``_pytest.fixtures``). We accept this because (a) the upstream fix
    (#11284) has been stuck in deprecation cycles for years, and (b) the
    speedup is ~1 s wall per file for parametrize-heavy suites. To minimize
    risk we:

    * Validate that ``getfuncargnames`` has the expected ``(function, *, name,
      cls)`` signature before patching, and skip silently with a warning if
      pytest's internals have changed.
    * Stash the originals so ``pytest_unconfigure`` restores them.
    * Honor ``QUACK_PYTEST_NO_GETFUNCARGNAMES_CACHE=1`` to opt out at runtime.

    Subtlety: ``_pytest.fixtures`` does ``from .compat import getfuncargnames``
    at import time, so we must rebind the name on both modules.

# everything else runs and reports normally. Tests that keep deferring past
# _MAX_ATTEMPTS run one final attempt with the pool suppressed (in-process
# compile) so persistent failures surface as ordinary test failures.
#
# Two execution modes:
#
# * Single-process pytest: ``_SingleProcDeferLoop`` replaces the default
#   ``pytest_runtestloop`` with a deque that rotates deferred items to the
#   back.
#
# * xdist worker: xdist's ``WorkerInteractor`` owns the runtestloop, but it
#   invokes ``pytest_runtest_protocol`` as a hook, so ``_XdistWorkerDefer``
#   takes over the protocol (tryfirst + firstresult). Deferred items are
#   stashed; the master receives ``runtest_protocol_complete`` immediately
#   (its ``mark_test_complete`` is a plain order-independent ``.remove()``)
#   and keeps streaming new items to the worker -- skip-ahead for free.
#   Stashed items are opportunistically re-run between incoming items as
#   their compiles finish, and fully drained in a ``pytest_runtestloop``
#   hookwrapper after xdist's inner loop exits (channel still open, so late
#   reports flow to the master normally).

# A test needing K distinct cold kernels defers K times (keys are discovered
# serially: each attempt stops at the first missing kernel). Attempts are
# cheap — an item is only re-run once its awaited sha resolves — so the cap
# just needs to exceed the realistic kernels-per-test count; past it, the
# final attempt compiles in-process (pool suppressed) so a wedged pool can't

# the worker). The one integrity hole this opens: a worker that crashes with
# deferred items still stashed loses them SILENTLY — the master already
# counted them complete, so nothing else will notice the missing reports.
# This check closes the hole: at session end, any collected-but-unreported,
# non-deselected test flips the exit status to failure.
